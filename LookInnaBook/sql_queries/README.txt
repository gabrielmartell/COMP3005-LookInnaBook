This README is related specifically to this folder.
This folder holds SQL queries (DDL) that can be executed without needing the result.

The folder names are self-explanatory, but for restatement, create_tables.sql creates the tables, delete_tables.sql deletes the tables, and finally
fill_tables.sql fills the tables with information. Please refer to the folder in this same directories "SQL Queries (Non-DDL)" as it refers to DQL calls.

When reading the DQL queries, their utilization is in the same order as they are listed. Each SQL is also named after their interface usage. 
(e.g, registry_queries.sql will include ALL queries used in the registry/registering component)
